# HangmanüïπÔ∏è

A word game in which one player must guess the letters in a word that the other player has thought of. Every time they guess a wrong letter, a portion of a picture of a person being hanged is drawn, and the person guessing loses if the picture is completed.

  pip install pyinstaller
```

Once pyinstaller has been installed, cd to current directory and then run the following command:

```bash
  cd hangman
```

```bash
  pyinstaller hangman.py --onefile
```

Once this process is done, you will see a /dist folder where you'll find the hangman.exe
